# Random Message generator

Hi! This is a small and easy project for my full stack course on Codecademy

### How it works?
Every time you run the program you get a diffrent motivational quote.
I used an array to store all the messages, a function wich picks a different message every time
and inside the function 2 variables that stores the values for the message and the date.
